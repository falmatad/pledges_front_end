                    But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
                    pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
                    account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
                    great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human
                    happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
                    because it is pleasure, but because those who
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur
                    in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To
                    take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
                    physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But
                    who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a
                    pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a
                    pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we
                    denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so
                    beguiled.
